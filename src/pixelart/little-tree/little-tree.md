so, in order to get better at making pixel art i started to get into tutorials for learning.

for now, my first learning source was youtube. i started to watch a lot of pixelart art channels for begginer tips and tricks to start making my first compositions.

one thing i learned is not to start making big pixelarts canvas, instead you can start with a 8x8 canvas. it's more easier to create very little drawings and you have more control about space and colors.

this is my first composition, its like a mario's ghost but witk a pink ink. this drawing has very little variations (same color but different shades) to start making shadows and lights.

i think it's pretty good just for my first (real) attemp.
