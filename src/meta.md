Welcome to my meta page!

This section is dedicated to everything that brings this website to life.
Also, inspired by the [meta web-ring](https://meta-ring.hedy.dev).


[bitbyte.blog](https://www.bitbyte.blog) is my personal corner on the web, built with a true craft mindset. It’s not meant to be a “perfect” or “standard” site — instead, it’s shaped with love, dedication, and countless late nights of coding.

This website also is my little site to make experiements (pixelart, animation, 3D) so maybe some pages could be broken.

A lot of cool ideas of this site are inspired on the cool community of [neocities](https://neocities.org/), such a 88x31 buttons, badges, cliques, etc.

All my posts are also available by RSS.


### Overview

This website is primarly made with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/), a Static Site Generator (SSG) powered by Node.js. A good point of start is to check [this](https://www.zachleat.com/web/eleventy-tutorial-level-1/).

You can explore all my source code [here](), if u want to fork it, u're more than welcome to.

The goal is simple: to provide anyone interested in building a website with a fully transparent example they can read, edit, and understand — line by line.


### Styling

I use a rather peculiar approach to styling my site. Instead of relying on a popular CSS framework like Tailwind, I work with SASS, paired with [Gorko](https://github.com/Andy-set-studio/gorko), a utility-first library that helps me create consistent design “units.”. Follwing the [CUBE CSS](https://cube.fyi/) methodology.

### Font
The font for this webiste is called _Free Pixel_, the orignal font comes from [sadgrl online](https://sadgrl.online/) but is hosted locally to avoid the hot loading.

The header was made with the help of [Text Fancy](https://textfancy.com/text-art/).

### Color
My favorite color-scheme, as always, is [catppuccin](https://catppuccin.com/). The other color-schemes are inspired by the community of [lospec](https://lospec.com/), a really good site for getting color-palletes.


### Assets
A lot of assets of this site are manually crafted by me with the help of [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/), my main software for making pixelart.

### Deployment
Hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com), which is a very good option for static site content.

### Webrings
This site is part of some cool [web-rings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webring).
