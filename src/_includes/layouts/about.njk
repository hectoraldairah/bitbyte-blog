          My name is HÃ©ctor Aldair Aguilar. I'm a front-end developer who enjoys
          making websites. I love the web with all its weirdness and I see
          software development as craft.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here is little corner on the web, where I post some stuff that I learn
          over the years, books reviews, and logs from the gym exercises.
        </p>

          This website will be constantly changing over time and that's funny.

          creating TUI's and CLI's.
