            My name is HÃ©ctor Aldair Aguilar. I'm a front-end developer who
            enjoys making websites. I love the web with all its weirdness. This
            is just my little personal place on the web where I post some stuff
            that I learn over the years, book recommendations, and logs from the
            gym exercises.
          </p>
          <p>
            This website will be constantly changing over time and that's funny.
          </p>
          <p>
            Right now, I'm working with Design Systems and making the web
            accessible for everyone.

            I work at <a href="https://www.clip.mx" class="link">Clip</a> as a
            front-end developer. React is my bread and butter.

            I'm part of the group of Developer Experience, our job to help
            developers to make better software for our products.

            When I'm not writing code, I enjoy going to the gym, cooking and
            learning about gastronomy. Recently I started to get in to
