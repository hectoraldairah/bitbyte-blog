<a href="#l13" class="line" id="l13">     13</a> It&#39;s the end of the year, and I&#39;m starting to think about what I want to learn in 2022.
<a href="#l14" class="line" id="l14">     14</a> 
<a href="#l15" class="line" id="l15">     15</a> 1. A new programming language: I&#39;m thinking on Clojure, Elm, or Elixir. I need to understand better the concepts of functional programming and how to use them. Maybe I&#39;ll use this expertise to apply javascript.
<a href="#l16" class="line" id="l16">     16</a> 
<a href="#l17" class="line" id="l17">     17</a> 2. A new pixel art tool: I used to work with Photoshop and Adobe Flash to make pixel art animations, but I don&#39;t want to use them anymore (I can&#39;t run any Adobe App now) so I&#39;m thinking to use [aseprite](https://aseprite.org) because I did some basic animation with it two years ago.
<a href="#l18" class="line" id="l18">     18</a> 
<a href="#l19" class="line" id="l19">     19</a> 3. Blender: I did some 3D animations when I was like 16? on an old mini laptop that I had. It was good at the time with only 2 Gb of ram but man, the software is getting ram expensive. Maybe I can start to make some things with my new computer.
<a href="#l20" class="line" id="l20">     20</a> 4. How to talk in public: Since 2019, I get the interest to do talks about tech with one cup of acid humor on it. The pandemic was a big problem here because there are no more live meetups and I just forget about it. With the online meetups, I can feel a chance to do it.
<a href="#l21" class="line" id="l21">     21</a> 5. Back-end: Well, maybe this is kind of huge for me. I&#39;ve been doing front-end stuff for a while and my backend skills are getting pretty bad. My experience working with [Express](https://expressjs.com/es/) and [Adonis](https://adonisjs.com/) was pretty good, but it was simple things. I don&#39;t know anything about databases too. So, yeah. Maybe I&#39;ll buy a course from [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/) for it.
<a href="#l22" class="line" id="l22">     22</a> 6. CSS Art: Yes, another art stuff. All the [beautiful CSS art that is on codepen](https://codepen.io/tag/css-art) makes me want to do something similar. I&#39;m not sure what exactly but some 3D CSS animations are on my eye.
<a href="#l23" class="line" id="l23">     23</a> 7. Being fluent in Esperanto and learning more about romantic languages: Duolingo and [Lernu](https://lernu.net/) are my best friends here.
<a href="#l24" class="line" id="l24">     24</a> 
<a href="#l25" class="line" id="l25">     25</a> That&#39;s it. I don&#39;t want to write more on this post to avoid feeling bad at the end of 2022.
<a href="#l26" class="line" id="l26">     26</a> 
<a href="#l27" class="line" id="l27">     27</a> Happy 2022!
