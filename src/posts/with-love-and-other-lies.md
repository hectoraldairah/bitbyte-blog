Have you ever seen this legend in a lot of websites? It's ALWAYS in the footer of a web page.

> Made with ❤️ and (coffee, mushrooms, sugar, etc)

Even I use to have it in my old sites.

A was thinking about it. It's kind of weird, isn't? It's kinda like a meme of web-development.

No one knows where this trend began and I think that is very hard to know it,
there is no metrics for this (maybe because it doesn't matter).

I think this is a LIE, yes a very hard lie to tell to our users. Ok, ok, I'm not judging your love and dedication for
your site. I think is just a _cliche_ and very burned by now.
