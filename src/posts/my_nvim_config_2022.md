I've been using the vim/nvim ecosystem for more than a year and I just love it.
Using nvim improved my workflow so much after I learned the basics of it and how to properly create a base configuration.

It's not so much hard to use despite the **insanely amount** of memes on Twitter. Please, stop with the exit vim joke is not funny anymore.

I'll write a post about some programming jokes that aged like milk.

## Lua is love â™¡

VIM comes with a config file, typically the .vimrc that is written on vimscript.
Even though, is not that bad. I find it difficult to manually configure and the .vimrc file becomes so big if you add a lot of plugins to try.

NVIM uses Lua as an alternative to configuring nvim. It's a very easy programming language, you can learn the basics in a week and start using it with that, you can create a more organized structure to save your plugins and config files.
Another advantage to using Lua is the community around it.

A lot of new plugins for nvim are written on Lua, making it faster than other languages like Javascript.

Also, making my NVIM config modular helps **a lot** with the organization of everthing.

Next, I'm gonna tell you what plugins I use the most.

## Most Have Plugins

This plugins are a must if you wanna improve you NVIM experience.

### Telescope

This is one of the plugins I use the most, one of the best fuzzy finders around here. I like how fast it is and a lot of the options that you can configure with it.
Search by file or by a regex expression with a pleaseant UI

### NVIMTREE

I see it as the NEERDTREE improved, very ligth and fast as a consecuence.
You can use web-dev-icons. Extremely configurable but no overwhelming

### NVIM TREE SITTER

Tree sitter for nvim, a perser genereator for our code. It can provide sintax highlight for different languanges with their own server and configuration.
This is very helpful because you can have a lot of cool features for your favorite programming language
The list of supported languages is huge
