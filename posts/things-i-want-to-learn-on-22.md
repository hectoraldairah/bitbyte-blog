It's the end of the year, and I'm starting to think about what I want to learn in 2022.

1. A new programming language: I'm thinking on Clojure, Elm, or Elixir. I need to understand better the concepts of functional programming and how to use them. Maybe I'll use this expertise to apply javascript.

2. A new pixel art tool: I used to work with Photoshop and Adobe Flash to make pixel art animations, but I don't want to use them anymore (I can't run any Adobe App now) so I'm thinking to use [aseprite](https://aseprite.org) because I did some basic animation with it two years ago.

3. Blender: I did some 3D animations when I was like 16? on an old mini laptop that I had. It was good at the time with only 2 Gb of ram but man, the software is getting ram expensive. Maybe I can start to make some things with my new computer.
4. How to talk in public: Since 2019, I get the interest to do talks about tech with one cup of acid humor on it. The pandemic was a big problem here because there are no more live meetups and I just forget about it. With the online meetups, I can feel a chance to do it.
5. Back-end: Well, maybe this is kind of huge for me. I've been doing front-end stuff for a while and my backend skills are getting pretty bad. My experience working with [Express](https://expressjs.com/es/) and [Adonis](https://adonisjs.com/) was pretty good, but it was simple things. I don't know anything about databases too. So, yeah. Maybe I'll buy a course from [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/) for it.
6. CSS Art: Yes, another art stuff. All the [beautiful CSS art that is on codepen](https://codepen.io/tag/css-art) makes me want to do something similar. I'm not sure what exactly but some 3D CSS animations are on my eye.
7. Being fluent in Esperanto and learning more about romantic languages: Duolingo and [Lernu](https://lernu.net/) are my best friends here.

That's it. I don't want to write more on this post to avoid feeling bad at the end of 2022.

Happy 2022!
