This is my first time reading Haruki Murakami. I've heard a lot of good things about this book so I give it a try.

The book is really good in terms of story-telling, every detail such as time, places, people description, and even food is very well written. You can imagine very easily all the environments that Murakami presents and keep following the story, a very easy lecture.

The book sadly doesn't contain so many references to the Japan of the era, just very few hints of social and political change and people's behavior rather a bunch of very good song's that you can find on Spotify that follow the protagonist and his friends?

I said friends? 'cause I think the protagonist is just keeping relations with everyone just for not to be alone rather than being purely friendly. This is just for the case of men, if you're a woman in this book, is very sure that you will be sexualized even for the smallest things.

Maybe is a reflection of the writer, the all I want I get protagonist and the Japan of the era.

I'm not sure if I want to read more from Murakami. Maybe later.
